    <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
    <p>Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
        The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
        This sorting algorithm is relatively slow and is primarily used for educational purposes due to its simplicity. 
    </p>
    <div><h2>How bubble sort works:</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
      
       <li><b>Comparing Adjacent Elements:</b>
        Bubble sort starts by comparing the first two elements in the list. It checks if the first element is greater than the second.</li>
        
       <li><b>Swapping:</b>
        If the first element is greater than the second, the two elements are swapped. This process is repeated for every adjacent pair of elements in the list.
       </li>
        <li><b>One Pass Through the List:</b>
        After one pass through the list, the largest unsorted element will have "bubbled up" to the end of the list. This means that the largest element is now in its correct sorted position.
        </li>
       <li> <b>Repeating the Process:</b>
        The process is then repeated for the remaining unsorted elements (excluding the last one), with each pass through the list placing the next largest element in its proper position.
        </li>
        <li><b>Repeating the Entire Process:</b>
        Steps 1-4 are repeated until no more swaps are needed in a full pass through the list. At this point, the list is fully sorted.
        </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Efficiency:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bubble Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, particularly for large lists. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements to be sorted. </li>
        <li>It is a stable sort, meaning it maintains the relative order of equal elements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Best Case</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> The best-case scenario for Bubble Sort occurs when the input list is already sorted. In this case, the algorithm will make one pass through the list to confirm that no swaps are needed and will complete in linear time.</li> 
    <li> <b> Time Complexity:</b>O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Worst Case</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The worst-case scenario for Bubble Sort occurs when the input list is sorted in reverse order (the largest elements are at the beginning). This forces the algorithm to make the maximum number of comparisons and swaps.</li> 
    <li> <b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Use Cases:</h2>
    <p><ul><li><b>Educational Purposes:</b> Bubble Sort is often used as an introductory example to teach sorting algorithms and the concept of algorithmic complexity (big O notation) due to its simplicity.</li>

<li><b>Small Datasets:</b> In situations where the dataset is small, and code simplicity is prioritized over efficiency, Bubble Sort can be used.</li>

<li><b>Debugging and Testing:</b> Bubble Sort can be useful in testing and debugging scenarios due to its straightforward implementation. It can be used to verify whether more complex sorting algorithms are working correctly, as it's easy to understand and implement.</li>
